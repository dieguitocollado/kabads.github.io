SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) is a linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control policies. This can support the protection from tampering and bypassing threats that might be possible with certain applications.

A Linux kernel that uses SELinux enforces mandatory access control policies that confine user programs and system services, also including file and network resources. If a program or daemon becomes compromised in an SELinux kernel space, then it is confined and limits the damage that can be caused.

SELinux users and roles do not have to be related to the actual system users and roles. For every current user or process, SELinux assigns a three string context consisting of username, role and domain (or type). This system is more flexible than normally required.

### Working with SELinux Modes
SELinux has three modes:
- Enforcing: Rules are enforced and violations are logged
- Permissive: No rule enforcement, violations logged
- Disabled: SELinux is not operational and no logging is enabled

To find out which mode the current system is in:

    sestatus

You can also find out the config with:

    cat /etc/selinux/config

(or, whatever SELinux root directory was identified in the previous command).

Changing any of the settings in the above file will need a restart.

To see the SELinux status of any particular file, pass the ```-Z``` flag to ```ls```:

    ls -Z somefile 

Type:

setenforce 0

which will turn off the enforce, but a reboot means that this will be ignored and a reboot would be in enforced mode. 

To change mode over a reboot edit ```/etc/selinux/config```:

    SELINUX=permissive

Now, when you look at status, you will see that both config file and current mode are permissive.

```setenforce``` can only be set with ```enforced``` or ```permissive``` on the command line.' ```disabled``` is allowed in the configuration file. 


### Controlling User Access
By default, all users are equal. User restrictions are not implemented. All users run as the ```unconfined_u``` SELinux user, without intervention. 

#### SELinux User Capabilities

The admin user pretty much has all rights. 

| User | X-Windows | su/sudo | Execute /tmp ~ | Networking |
|-----------------------------------------------------------
| sysadm_u | yes | both | yes | yes | 
| staff_u | yes | sudo | yes | yes |
| user_u | yes | no | yes | yes | 
| guest_u | no | no | no | no | 
| xguest_u | yes | no | no | Firefox | 

```staff_u``` can do everything apart from ```su```. ```user_u``` can do everything apart from root escalation rights. ```guest_u``` can do nothing. ```xguest_u``` can use Firefox as the only command process that uses networking. 

To see what user we are use:

    id -Z

Usually, on a default install, a user is ```unconfined_u```. 

To find out the SELinux users:

    semanage login -l 

The ```__default__``` user is the one that will be applied to new users. This is usually ```unconfined_u```. This is the same as root. This will need changing:

    semanage login -m -s user_u -r s0 __default__

Now, all new users will receive the same as ```user_u```. 

Lunx user accounts are mapped to SELinux users. We can use the ```login``` option to list out these mappings:

    semanage login -l 

will give the output:

    Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range        Service

    __default__          unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
    root                 unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
    system_u             system_u            s0-s0:c0.c1023       *

showing that ```__default__``` is ```unconfined_u```. This means there are no restrictions in place. 

Changing the default assignment will also affect all users previously assigned to it. To manage the assignment of an existing user with ```semanage```. 

    semanage login -m -s "user_u" -r s0 __default__

Now if you check your SELinux users, you will see that ```__default__``` is now assigned to the ```user_u```:

    Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range        Service

    __default__          user_u               s0                   *
    root                 unconfined_u          s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
    system_u             system_u             s0-s0:c0.c1023       *


NOTE: This will stop all users from gaining ```su``` and ```sudo``` access.

To change this for a particular user: 

    semanage login -a -s unconfined_u lisa

This command means that lisa will now once again be able to gain root access. 

To list SELinux users we use the user option:

    semanage user -l 

The task is to assign linux accounts to SELinux accounts. We can use the ```-Z``` option to useradd or modify the default assignment, which will affect new accounts. 

    useradd -Z guest_u bob

To change this later:

    semanage login -a -s user_u bob

The two commands above firstly create a user bob and assign him to the guest_u user, and then the second command associates the username ```bob``` with the ```user_u``` SELinux user.
    

### Type Enforcement Rules

### Working with Booleans
Administrators can override SELinux enforced mode to get around problems. This can be a problem when you are trying to prevent opening up access. This can be prevented by requiring a reboot before a new mode is active. To do this you will need to set a boolean which prevents changing the mode without a reboot. 

    getsebool -a 

will show all the booleans that are in place for this runtime. The same can be achieved with:

    semanage boolean -l | grep secure_mode_policyload

To change this: 

    setsebool secure_mode_policyload on 
    getsebool -a |grep policy

    The latter command confirms that the boolean is on. 
    If you want the boolean to take place over a reboot:

    setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload on

The ```-P``` sets this to be transient over a reboot. 


### Diagnosing SELinux Issues

You can pass ```enforcing=0``` on a grub command line (the line that loads the kernel) to change to permissive mode. This helps if there is difficulty in logging in. If necessary, this means that you can check the permissions of any files that may have changed. 

This may require a file to be created ```/.autorelabel```, which will check through all the files and ensure that they are all relabeled according to the SELinux policies in place. Relabelling all the files can be time consuming and there is a quicker way by just relabelling the necessary files. 

If you find a question mark on ```ls -Z file``` then the file is unlabelled and cannot be verified by SELinux. To fix this:

    restorecon -v filename 

This will bring the label to the file. The ```restorecon``` command is good for relabelling just one file, instead of having to go through the whole filesytem.
